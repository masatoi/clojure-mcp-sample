# GEMINI Project Context

## Project Overview

This is a Clojure project designed for mathematical computations. It serves as a testbed for exploring and implementing various algorithms, primarily focused on different methods for approximating Pi (Ï€) and calculating Fibonacci numbers. The project is configured to work with the Gemini CLI and an nREPL server, allowing for interactive development and evaluation.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Language:** Clojure
*   **Dependency Management:** `deps.edn`
*   **Testing:** `clojure.test`
*   **Code Contracts:** `clojure.spec.alpha`

**Core Functionality:**

*   **Fibonacci:** Includes both a standard recursive implementation and a memoized version for efficiency.
*   **Pi Approximation:**
    *   Gauss-Legendre Algorithm
    *   Standard Monte Carlo method
    *   Monte Carlo with triangular importance sampling
    *   Monte Carlo with 2D normal distribution importance sampling

## Building and Running

### nREPL Server

To enable interactive development, start an nREPL server. The project is pre-configured with an alias for this.

```bash
# Start the nREPL server (defaults to port 7888)
clojure -M:nrepl
```

### Running Tests

The `README.md` provides commands for running tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
clojure -M -e "(require '[clojure.test :as test]) (require '[myapp.core-test]) (test/run-all-tests #\"^myapp.*-test$\")"

# Run tests for a specific namespace
clojure -M -e "(require '[clojure.test :as test]) (require '[myapp.core-test]) (test/run-tests 'myapp.core-test)"
```

### Running the Main Function

The project has a `-main` function in the `myapp.core` namespace, which can be executed as follows:

```bash
# Run the main function
clojure -M -m myapp.core
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Source Code:** All source code is located in the `src/` directory, following standard Clojure conventions.
*   **Tests:** Tests are located in the `test/` directory. Each function in `myapp.core` has corresponding tests in `myapp.core-test`.
*   **Function Specs:** `clojure.spec.alpha` is used to define specifications (specs) for all public functions. These specs are defined at the top of the `myapp.core.clj` file and serve as contracts for function arguments and return values.
*   **Documentation:** Public functions include docstrings explaining their purpose.
